## Serial Communication Test

This tutorial is composed by the source files of the implementation of a fixed-wing aircraft HIL control platform whose content is awaiting review for publication in the 26th COBEM.

## Features

For the communication test and configuration of the serial protocol, an example was implemented to be embedded in the microcontroller to control the aircraft simulated in Matlab Simulink®. To do this, load the file "HIL\_Serial\_Test.ino" for the chosen microcontroller and then load the file "Hil\_Serial\_Test.slx", in the Matlab Simulink® environment.
